# React-Redux-Project--Rails-API

This API was designed to provide data to the front end client, allowing users to modify and persist data to the back end.

The repo for the front end can be found at : https://github.com/jhharwood88/React-Redux-Project--Front-End

To install this server you must first fork and clone the repo. The user will then run bundle install to load all gem dependencies for the application. The API server can then be run on port 3001 using rails s -p 3001.
